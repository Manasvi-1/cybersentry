AI-Powered Cybersecurity Platform for Phishing and Deepfake Detection

I. Overview

CyberSentry is an advanced cybersecurity platform that integrates state-of-the-art techniques in artificial intelligence to detect phishing attempts and deepfake content. In addition, it leverages honeypot technology and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) methods to provide real-time threat intelligence and system monitoring.

II. Features
	1.	AI-Driven Phishing Detection – Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze URLs and flag potential phishing threats.
	2.	Deepfake Detection – Applies deep learning to identify synthetic media and fraudulent audio/video content.
	3.	Honeypot Integration – Deploys honeypots to lure and study cyber threats in controlled environments.
	4.	OSINT Automation – Gathers and processes open-source data to support threat analysis.
	5.	Real-Time Alerting – Provides immediate notifications when potential security breaches are detected.
